Parking space counter via Image Processing with AI.

# Parking Space Management Projects

This repository houses Python scripts designed for managing parking spaces through image processing techniques. They demonstrate how to count and select parking spaces within a designated area.

## Projects Overview

The repository includes the following scripts:

1. `parking_space_counter.py` - This script analyzes a given image of a parking lot and counts the number of available parking spaces.
2. `parking_space_picker.py` - This script selects the best available parking space based on predefined criteria such as proximity to the entrance.

Each script utilizes computer vision libraries to process and analyze the visual data from parking areas.

## Setup and Running the Scripts

### Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure that you have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
- NumPy: For handling multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/Parking-Space-Counter.git
```

Navigate to the cloned directory and install the required Python libraries using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
## Usage
To run the parking_space_counter.py, execute the following command:

```
python parking_space_counter.py
```

To run the parking_space_picker.py, execute the following command:

```
python parking_space_picker.py
```

## Libraries Used
OpenCV: Utilized for image acquisition, processing, and analysis tasks.
NumPy: Employed for efficient numerical computations, particularly for array operations.

## Contributing
If you have suggestions for improving the scripts, or if you want to report a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
